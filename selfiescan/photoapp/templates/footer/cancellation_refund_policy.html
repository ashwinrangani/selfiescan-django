    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="p-8 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-8 border border-gray-200">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
            Welcome to SelfieScan ("we," "us," or "our"). This Cancellation and Refund Policy outlines the terms under which you may cancel your subscription and request a refund for payments made through our platform. We aim to provide a fair and transparent process for all users. By subscribing to SelfieScan, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.
        </p>

    <!-- Subscription Cancellation -->
    <div class="p-8 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-8 border border-gray-200">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Subscription Cancellation</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
            SelfieScan operates on a subscription model, with a monthly fee (e.g., ₹500/month). You may cancel your subscription at any time by following these steps:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside  space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li>Log in to your SelfieScan account.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the "Account Settings" or "Subscription" section.</li>
            <li>Select the "Cancel Subscription" option and confirm your cancellation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Upon cancellation, your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle. You will not be charged for the next billing cycle, and your access to SelfieScan will cease at the end of the current cycle. To avoid losing access to your data (e.g., uploaded photos), please download or export your content before the billing cycle ends.
        </p>
